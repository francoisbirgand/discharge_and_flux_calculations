# Article discussing instantaneous vs interval-mean discharge values and their consequences on flux calculations

This article was written with several ideas in mind.  
* The first one was to bring to the attention of hydrologists and non hydrologists, some subtleties that exist in the nature of time series of flow rates and water quality
* The second was an exploration of the use of R markdown so that it may eventually be used as a reference for my students and myself

This repository thus contains several files of different formats with essentially the same basic information, but presented differently, whether it be in html, gitub, pdf, word or Rmd.  Hopefully, this will be a useful start in that path
