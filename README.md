# Article discussing instantaneous vs interval-mean discharge values and their consequences on flux calculations

This article was written with several ideas in mind.  
* The first one was to bring to the attention of hydrologists and non hydrologists, some subtleties that exist in the nature of time series of flow rates and water quality
* The second was an exploration of the use of R markdown so that it may eventually be used as a reference for my students and myself
* The third was to use some intermediate level tricks that I have found useful in R

This repository thus contains several files of different formats with essentially the same basic information, but presented differently, whether it be in html, gitub, pdf, word or Rmd.  The .Rmd file is the source file, from which all other formats are created through the 'knitr' package. Hopefully, this will be a useful first step towards the goal of having all our theses and articles written with this great tools.  This is the very near future of research, we must embark in it as soon as possible.
